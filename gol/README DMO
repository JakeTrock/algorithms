 
Doctor Morgan,
I write this with great regret as my clock approaches 10:00 pm. Believe it or not, but I have done no homework today, I have worked on the game of life for 4 hours straight, only breaking to have dinner and ask my father a question.
I am too tired to keep working, so I wrote a program that satisfied the requirements, but it will irk me for the rest of my days that there was a mountain that I turned back from climbing. It isn't the first, nor will it be the last,
but this just seemed like more of a mound than a mountain. Talk about making molehills out of mountains. Anyhow, I tend to ramble when I'm tired, so I'll say this, I've packaged the two versions that I attempted so you can see that I 
at least tried. I'm so sorry Dr. Morgan. 

Jake
